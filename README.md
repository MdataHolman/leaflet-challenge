# leaflet-challenge
Module 15 Challenge

This challenge is to visualize an earthquake dataset. The dataset is from the USGS GeoJSON Feed http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php. 

Using Leaflet, the dashboard was created with data markers reflecting the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. 
Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
